# Answer template, week 1


## Task 1

To protect myself from cyber crimes, I have implemented several security measures across my devices and accounts. I use strong, unique passwords for each of my accounts and regularly update them. Additionally, I enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible, adding an extra layer of security. I ensure my devices and software are always up to date with the latest security patches. To minimize exposure to phishing attacks, I am cautious about the emails and links I open, verifying the sender's authenticity before interacting with any content. I also use reliable antivirus and anti-malware software to scan and protect my systems regularly.

Although I have not been a direct victim of cyber crimes, I recognize that the risk is always present. Reflecting on my practices, I could further improve by backing up my data more frequently and considering the use of a password manager to enhance the complexity of my passwords while maintaining convenience. Additionally, staying informed about the latest cyber threats and adjusting my security measures accordingly would be beneficial in preventing potential attacks.


## Task 2

1. Password Management Policy
Objective:
To establish a secure and consistent approach to password management that protects the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of company systems and information.

Issue Statement:
Passwords are a critical element of the companyâ€™s security infrastructure, serving as the first line of defense against unauthorized access. Weak or compromised passwords pose a significant risk to company resources, potentially leading to data breaches, loss of intellectual property, and financial damage.

Policy Position:
All employees, contractors, and third-party vendors accessing company systems must adhere to the following password management guidelines:

Password Creation: Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The use of easily guessable information such as names, birthdays, or common words is prohibited.

Password Updates: Users are required to change their passwords every 90 days. Systems will enforce this change by prompting users to update their passwords at regular intervals.

Password Protection: Users must not share passwords with anyone, including colleagues or IT personnel. Passwords should never be written down or stored in plain text files. The use of password managers is recommended to securely store and manage complex passwords.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Where applicable, 2FA must be enabled to provide an additional layer of security beyond the password.

Applicability:
This policy applies to all systems, applications, and services that require user authentication, including but not limited to email accounts, internal databases, cloud services, and remote access tools. It is applicable to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who access company resources.

Roles and Responsibilities:

IT Department: Responsible for enforcing password policies, providing technical support for password resets, and ensuring systems are configured to meet password complexity and update requirements.
Employees and Users: Responsible for adhering to this policy by creating and managing their passwords according to the guidelines and reporting any suspected security incidents related to password compromise.
Compliance:
Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary actions, including restricted access to company systems, termination of employment, or legal action in severe cases of negligence.

Points of Contact:
For questions or further guidance on this policy, users should contact the IT Security team or their immediate supervisor.

2. BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) Policy
Objective:
To safeguard company data and systems while allowing employees the flexibility to use personal devices for work-related tasks, ensuring a secure working environment.

Issue Statement:
The use of personal devices for work purposes introduces security risks, including the potential for data breaches, malware infections, and unauthorized access to company resources. It is essential to mitigate these risks through a structured BYOD policy.

Policy Position:
Employees are permitted to use their personal devices for work-related tasks under the following conditions:

Device Approval: All personal devices must be approved by the IT department before they can access company systems. Approved devices must meet minimum security requirements, including updated operating systems, antivirus software, and device encryption.

Security Requirements:

Encryption: All devices must use encryption to protect data stored on the device.
Authentication: Devices must be secured with a strong password, PIN, or biometric authentication.
Software Updates: Users must ensure their devices are regularly updated with the latest security patches.
Access Control:

VPN Usage: When accessing the company network remotely, employees must use the company-provided VPN to ensure secure data transmission.
Restricted Access: Access to sensitive information will be limited based on the employee's role and the necessity of access.
Data Management:

Company Data: Users must not store company data on personal devices unless absolutely necessary, and such data must be encrypted.
Data Wipe: In cases of device loss, theft, or employment termination, the IT department reserves the right to remotely wipe company data from the personal device.
Applicability:
This policy applies to all employees who wish to use personal devices such as smartphones, tablets, or laptops for accessing company resources. It also applies to contractors and third-party vendors who require access to company systems via personal devices.

Roles and Responsibilities:

IT Department: Responsible for approving devices, providing security software, and enforcing this policy.
Employees: Responsible for ensuring their devices meet the required security standards and reporting any incidents of device loss or compromise immediately.
Compliance:
Failure to comply with this policy may result in loss of BYOD privileges, disciplinary actions, or termination of employment.

Points of Contact:
Employees should contact the IT Support team for any issues related to device approval, security compliance, or reporting security incidents.
